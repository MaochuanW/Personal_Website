                    Problem:
                    Detroit, MI, has experienced uniquely extreme economic and demographic changes over the past
                    half a century. Deindustrialization of the city as a result of automobile manufacturing decline
                    was a prime factor in the changes that the city experienced throughout the 20th century. In 1950,
                    the population of Detroit was nearly two million, while it barely exceeded 700,000 in 2010.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So What:
                    Detroit was an intriguing city to study for this project in terms of its population and land-use
                    change. While previous studies have looked at land-use change within the city, including the
                    fluctuation of vegetation (Ryznar 2007, Merry et al. 2014), our motivation for this study was to
                    better understand how the residential zoning changed from 1950 ordinances to 2010. The drastic
                    change in population size Detroit has experienced may have led to a variety of changes in the
                    distribution of land uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution:
                    We sought to analyze the spatial distribution of Detroit's overall population in the years 1950 and
                    2010, and compare current land use zoning ordinances with those that existed in 1950. Zoning, a
                    land use regulation tool that helps us better organize our built environment, is a metric of
                    land-use change that we decided to investigate. A zoning ordinance delineates what kinds of
                    activities are acceptable on a specific plot of land, the density at which those activities can be
                    performed, the height of buildings allowed to be built, and the spatial characteristics of the lot.
                    Zoning ordinances are enforceable regulations. However, the nature of zoning may change
                    depending on a variety of factors, such as population size and density. Our group aims to depict a
                    possible correlation between population density and the spatial composition of residential zoning
                    areas in Detroit between 1950 and 2010.
                </p>
                <P>
                    Benefits:
                    From our analysis, we were able to affirm that the population in Detroit decreased across the city
                    between 1950 and 2010. We also found that some areas of Detroit that were classified as
                    residential zones in 1950 had changed to be non-residential zones by the year 2010. We found
                    that this transformation was most commonly found along major transportation corridors. By
                    identifying the overall changes in population size within the city of Detroit, we can compare the
                    degree of change in residential land use zoning to that of population size. These analyses may aid
                    in our understanding of the practical use of zoning, and how change in policy may help to
                    identify issues of vacancy and abandonment in residential zones.
                </P>
                <P>Conclusion:
                    While we were able to deduce some findings from our analysis, there were certainly limitations
                    in regard to what we were able to uncover. Due to the fact that the size and shape of census tracts
                    changed from 1950 to 2010, we were unable to figure out the precise difference in population by
                    tract in Detroit from 1950 to 2010. A way to work around this in future work may be to
                    consolidate the population of smaller tracts and then compare this population with the larger
                    tracts that they overlap with based on the year, although this still would not be exact.
                    Additionally, because we had to georeference the 1950 zoning map, the mapping isn't perfectly
                    aligned with the basemap. Lastly, we were unable to adequately capture whether or not the
                    zoning change from 1950 to 2010 was statistically significant, which is something that could be
                    researched further.
