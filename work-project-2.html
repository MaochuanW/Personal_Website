            <p>This website is a new and improved version of the old <a href="https://viewers.apps.pgc.umn.edu/antarctica/"><strong>PGC imagery viewer</strong></a>. While it's still a work in progress and doesn't have all the features yet, it promises to include several exciting new features soon. Among the planned features are the ability to select a specific imagery layer, query imagery data, zoom in and out of the map, search for specific places, and zoom to specific coordinates. Additionally, the new version of the website will include a login system implemented through Keycloak JS, which will allow users to save and share maps and data across sessions. The website is also undergoing an aesthetic upgrade, with a cleaner and more modern design that makes it easier to navigate and use. Overall, this new version of the <strong>PGC imagery viewer</strong> shows great promise as a valuable tool for researchers and other users interested in exploring and analyzing satellite imagery of Antarctica.</p>
