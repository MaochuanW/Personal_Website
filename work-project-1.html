            <h1>Transporting Siberia</h1>
            <p>This project, led by social geographer Dr. Vera Kuklina, focuses on the impacts of informal roads on Siberia's environment, indigenous populations, and resource accessibility. Informal roads, or vehicular roadways beyond the publicly governed network, have expanded due to infrastructure projects, extractive industries, and increased connectivity needs. They include forestry roads, geological roads, and public general-use roads.

                The Evenki people, an indigenous group in the region, have experienced significant changes in mobility and subsistence living due to informal road development. The research team employs satellite images and fieldwork to assess environmental and social consequences brought on by the expansion of informal roads. The project highlights hazards such as permafrost degradation, surface erosion, and wildfire-related disturbance, all of which pose risks to local mobility and resources. The study underscores the need for greater attention to the environmental and societal implications of informal road networks in Siberia.</p>
